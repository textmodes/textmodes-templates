After the successful launch of [BBS Ninja](http://bbs.ninja/) in June 2014,
we have had a lot of positive feedback. The [BBS Ninja](http://bbs.ninja/)
project focused on the PC text art scene, but there is so much more beautiful
work out there!

This is why we started building [TEXTMOD.ES](http://textmod.es/) which will
become a more general archive of the text art history. At the moment we're
working on a [Amiga](http://amiga.textmod.es/) and [PC](http://pc.textmod.es/)
sub sites, but more will follow soon!
